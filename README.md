# Data Structures Course Projects

Developed by: Farnaz Zinnah

## Projects Overview

This repository contains three key projects from a Data Structures course, showcasing skills in implementing complex data structures and algorithms in C++.

### Binary Tree (bintree)
A C++ implementation of a binary tree data structure, providing functions such as `inorder`, `tree_clear`, `insert`, `tree_copy`, and `tree_size`. It offers insights into binary tree manipulations like inserting nodes, copying trees, and traversing trees in different orders.

### Sequence1
An array-based sequence class implementation (`sequence1`) that allows operations like `insert`, `attach`, `remove_current`, and navigation through the sequence (`start`, `advance`). It provides a practical application of array manipulation and sequence control in C++.

### Sequence2
A linked-list-based sequence class implementation (`sequence2`), demonstrating advanced usage of pointers and dynamic memory. It includes methods for list manipulation, such as `insert`, `attach`, `remove_current`, `start`, and `advance`.

Each project includes detailed implementation and showcases various aspects of data structures, offering a foundational understanding of both array and linked-list-based sequences in C++.
